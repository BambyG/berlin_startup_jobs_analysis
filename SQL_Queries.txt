According to the Trello Card, SQL queires match the questions:

1. What are the TOP 10 skills required by companies?

 SELECT skill_name, COUNT(*) FROM Skills_12_june
GROUP BY skill_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;

2. How often the level of experience is required in job description?

SELECT Company_name, Jobtitle FROM Stackoverflow_jobs_12_june
WHERE Description LIKE('%experience%') AND Description LIKE('%years%');

3. How many technical skills are required (distribution)?

SELECT nb_of_skills, COUNT(*) as counts_per_cat FROM 
(SELECT Jobtitle, COUNT(skill_name) AS nb_of_skills FROM Stackoverflow_jobs_12_june
JOIN Skills_12_june ON ID = job_id
GROUP BY Jobtitle) AS Counts
GROUP BY nb_of_skills
ORDER BY counts_per_cat DESC ;
